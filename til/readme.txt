This plugin allows you to add again the Technorati Incoming Links to your dashboard (in Wordpress 2.3 or later)

== Description ==

If you have upgraded your blog to Wordpress 2.3, you have noticed that the Dashboard "Incoming Links" has been replaced from Technorati to Google Blog Search. For who would like to restore the Technorati Incoming Links (without remove the new Google Blog Search) I coded this plugin. I hope it is useful.

== Installation ==

- Download the plugin TIL (Technorati Incoming Links)
- uncompress it with your preferred unzip/untar program or use the command line: tar xzvf til.tar.gz
- copy the file til.php in your plugins directory at your wordpress blog (/wp-content/plugins)
- activate the TIL Wordpress plugin at your Plugins admin page
